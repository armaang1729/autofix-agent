# Code & PR Standards

- Keep changes minimal and scoped to the issue.
- Preserve existing style (indentation, quotes, naming) in the codebase.
- Add or update tests when fixing bugs or adding behavior.
- PR titles should be clear; prefer "Fix: <short description>" or "Add: <feature>".
- Commit messages: start with a verb (Fix, Add, Update, Refactor) and reference the issue when applicable (e.g., "Fix login redirect (#42)").
